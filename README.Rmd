## Overview

predictNMB is a tool to evaluate clinical prediction models based on their estimated Net Monetary Benefit (NMB).

`{predictNMB}` has two main functions: 

- `do_nmb_sim()`: takes user defined inputs for a given prediction model and population, then evaluates the NMB by performing simulations.
- `screen_simulation_inputs()`: calls `do_nmb_sim()` many times, using a range of values for any of its inputs. This is useful for sensitivity analysis.

## Installation

You can install the development version of predictNMB from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RWParsons/predictNMB")
```

## Estimating model cutpoints

Hypothetical NMB associated with each square of a confusion matrix must first be defined.

```{r}
library(predictNMB)

fx_nmb <- get_nmb_sampler(
  outcome_cost = 100,
  high_risk_group_treatment_effect = 0.35,
  high_risk_group_treatment_cost = 10
)

fx_nmb()
```

Required arguments:

- `n_sims`: number of simulations to run. More simulations take longer, but are more stable
- `event_rate`: event incidence rate, or the proportion of patients experiencing the event
- `sim_auc`: vector of hypothetical AUCs; e.g. `seq(0.7, 0.95, 0.05)` or `c(0.75, 0.80, 0.85)`
- `n_valid`: number of samples the validation set draws within each simulation (evaluating the NMB under each cutpoint)
- `fx_nmb_training`: function-defined vector used to get cutpoints on the training set. Recommended to use constant values
- `fx_nmb_evaluation`: function-defined vector used to get cutpoints on the evaluation set. Recommended to use sampled values
- (Optional) Users can pass a cluster as the `cl` argument. If it is passed, the simulations are run in parallel (faster).

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(parallel)
cl <- makeCluster(detectCores())
sim_screen_obj <- screen_simulation_inputs(
  n_sims = 1000, n_valid = 10000, sim_auc = seq(0.7, 0.95, 0.05), event_rate = 0.1,
  fx_nmb_training = fx_nmb, fx_nmb_evaluation = fx_nmb,
  cutpoint_methods = c("all", "none", "youden"), cl = cl
)
```

These simulations can be interpreted as a range of hypothetical situations under different levels of model performance within my specific healthcare setting. We can visualise how this change may affect preference between the model-guided strategy versus a treat-all or treat-non strategy.

`plot()` on the object returned from this function to quickly inspect these trends.

```{r, message=FALSE}
plot(sim_screen_obj)
```

Here, we are visualising many simulations under different inputs. If we want to inspect just a single set of inputs, say when the model AUC was 0.9, we can run that simulation alone using `do_nmb_sim()`, or access it from our existing screen.

```{r, eval=F}
single_sim_obj <- do_nmb_sim(
  n_sims = 1000, n_valid = 10000, sim_auc = 0.9, event_rate = 0.1,
  fx_nmb_training = fx_nmb, fx_nmb_evaluation = fx_nmb,
  cutpoint_methods = c("all", "none", "youden"), cl = cl
)
```

```{r}
single_sim_obj <- sim_screen_obj$simulations[[6]]
```

When plotting a single set of simulation inputs, we see the distributions of the NMB across all simulations under each strategy. 

```{r}
plot(single_sim_obj)
```
